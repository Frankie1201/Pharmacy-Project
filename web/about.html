        <p>NFS Pharmacy is committed to ‘healthcare for life’ and our vision is to be a great healthcare brand.
          Our customers are our main focus and we endeavour to provide them with exceptional service and healthcare. Accessibly located within the heart of communities, our local pharmacies are right on the doorstep and strive to be the first choice for customer needs.
          We are much more than a dispenser of medicines.
